## Prompt:

In the context of BrahmaKumaris murlis, can you tell by looking at the question below if you have enough context to answer the question accurately without making up things or you need external data to be able to answer the question. Specify exactly what you need to answer the question accurately.

Question:
"What is the overall sentiment in the avyakt murlis of 1969. How does the sentiment of murlis change from 1969 to 1970"

## Response: 
Based on the question, here's an analysis of what's needed to answer it accurately:

**What I Need to Answer Accurately:**

* **Access to the full text of the Avyakt Murlis of 1969 and 1970:**
    * To determine the "overall sentiment," I need to analyze the language, themes, and tone used throughout the murlis of each year.
    * This requires a deep reading and understanding of the text.
* **A framework for sentiment analysis specific to Brahma Kumaris terminology:**
    * "Sentiment" in this context goes beyond simple positive/negative emotions. It involves understanding the spiritual concepts and their emotional connotations within the Brahma Kumaris teachings.
    * For example, concepts like "remembrance," "service," "purity," and "divine love" have specific emotional and spiritual weight.
    * I would need to understand the context of how words are used within the Brahma Kumaris teachings.
* **A method for comparing and contrasting the sentiment between the two years:**
    * I need a way to identify and articulate the specific changes in sentiment from 1969 to 1970.
    * This may involve identifying shifts in emphasis, new themes, or changes in the way familiar themes are presented.

**Why External Data Is Necessary:**

* I do not have direct access to the full text of the Brahma Kumaris Avyakt Murlis.
* I do not have a pre-existing, specialized framework for sentiment analysis within the context of Brahma Kumaris teachings.
* Therefore, to answer the question accurately, I would need to be provided with the text of the murlis, or have access to a database of them, along with a guide to the specific meaning of terms used within those texts.

**2. Structured Data (Ideal for Larger Volumes):**

* **Text Files (.txt, .csv, .json):**
    * You can create text files containing the Murlis, with each Murli or paragraph clearly separated.
    * For the glossary, a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file would be ideal.
        * CSV: Term, Definition
        * JSON: { "term": "definition" }
    * While I cannot directly access local files on your computer, you can copy the contents of these files and paste them into our conversation in sections.
* **Considerations:**
    * Ensure the text files are accurately formatted and encoded (e.g., UTF-8) to preserve special characters.
    * If the Murlis are in a language other than English, clearly indicate the language.
* **Example of CSV Glossary:**
    ```csv
    Avyakt,Incorporeal, subtle angelic form
    Smriti,Remembrance, to remember God
    Seva,Service, actions done with divine intention
    ```

**3. Providing Context within the Conversation:**

* **Explain Key Concepts:**
    * Instead of a formal glossary, you can explain the meanings of terms as they appear in the text.
    * This is useful for providing context and nuanced interpretations.
* **Highlight Important Themes:**
    * Point out recurring themes or concepts that are relevant to the sentiment analysis.
    * This helps me understand the overall context of the Murlis.

**In summary:** Without the specific text of those Murlis, and without specific information on how to interpret the sentiment of those texts, I cannot give an accurate response.
