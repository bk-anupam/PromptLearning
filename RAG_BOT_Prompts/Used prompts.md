## Reranker Prompt: 
RAG_BOT is  an  agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. I have implement reranking mechanism in my RAG pipeline and what I observed was List[str] returned by my  retrieve_context tool becomes a str when accessed via last_message.content in the rerank_context_node. I got an explanation from an LLM about this behaviour. I want to understand how to correctly implement the reranking logic using langgraph if my retrieve_context tool returns a list of documents

Explanation:
ToolMessage.content attribute is designed to hold a string representation of the tool's output. As we saw, when a tool returns a non-string object like your List[str], the default behavior of the ToolNode is to serialize it (often using JSON) into that string content field. LangGraph's standard ToolNode serializes results into the ToolMessage.content string for compatibility and logging within the messages flow. However, tools themselves can return any Python object. You can access and use these complex objects either by:

Parsing the serialized string representation from ToolMessage.content.
Designing custom nodes that call the tool directly and store the raw Python object in a dedicated field within your AgentState.

## Need for json output prompt:
Why do we need to convert the LLM response to json format in our case. The final response is going to be display on telegram, hence it needs to be plain text. We don't get any benefit by asking LLM to provide final answer in json format. Can we just use the standard response

I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language, sometimes passing in date filter. Review the code in retriever_node function and suggest ways to improve the accuracy of search results from the vector db. Note that retriever_node is a node of the graph.

I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language, sometimes passing in date filter. My rag agent is kind of a conversational chatbot and retains at least the last 10 conversations in context so that it can answer the user queries with relevance. Can you suggest the code changes in bot.py and rag_agent.py to make this happen. 


I have built an MCP server named murli_mcp_server that works perfectly fine locally and allows me to retrieve pdf extracts from a local chroma db. Now this murli_mcp_server MCP server is to be used in rag_agent.py basically to perform the task currently being performed by the retriever_node. Basically I want the LLM(gemini 2.5 pro experimental) in rag_agent.py to be aware of the murli_mcp_server and use it when it deems fit that additional context (in form of murli extracts) is needed to answer a user query. I am using langgraph for building the agent. 
How does invoking tools exposed via an MCP server using a langgraph agent works. What is the best approach.


I want to extract the logic to retrieve pdf extracts from vectordb using a query from retriever_node in rag_agent.py and make this a tool call. Basically the retriever logic should be extracted into a new tool named murli_retriever (the tool logic can be a separate python file) and that tool is made available to the agent in rag_agent.py. The agent graph creation in build_agent method in rag_agent.py should be modified accordingly so that the agent makes a murli_retriever tool call when it deems necessary additional context information to answer user's question.

In the bind_agent method in rag_agent.py can't we do something like below
tools = [retrieve_murli_context]
llm.bind_tools(tools)
And then  use a ToolNode in the StateGraph. Just thinking if this would work. 


I have made changes to build_agent as per your suggestions. I want my agent stategraph structure to be like this: Agent -> Tool -> Agent -> End. Basically the agent node responds to the user query if no tool calls are needed. Can I just remove the generator_node logic and everything will work as expected. Currently system prompt is being used in the generator node, that needs to be taken care of in the agent node if generator node is to be removed.  


Can you explain the code in rag_agent.py step by step in detail. Basically I want to understand in detail how langgraph works under the hood to make the rag_agent functional. I understand that the code is building an agent that answers user's questions about Brahmakumaris murlis. It uses a murli_retriever_tool to retrieve murli extracts if it feels additional context is needed to answer the user's question. I basically want to understand in detail how the message flow happens, what are the different kinds of messages in langgraph, what is their use and how the code uses the messages in its workflow. Also I want to understand how langgraph performs state management of the agent, after execution of each node in the graph what exactly does langgraph do with the agent state.

RAG_BOT is  an  agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. In chroma vectorstore I am storing murli documents of several years. Each murli document is of a specific date. And for a particular month lets say you have 20 murli documents. I want to ask a question to LLM "What is the overall essence of murlis of Januray 1969?". Now this question is not going to find a semantic match in the documents, then how can I retrieve the relevant context for such queries in my RAG system.

I am building a agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. In my RAG agent graph, I have an agent_node which Invokes the LLM instance bound with tools to decide the next step or generate a response. The next step can be a tool call basically the retrieve_context tool that retrieves relevant context snippets from Brahmakumaris murlis stored in a Chroma vector database based on the user query. 
Now there might be the case that the context retrieved is not suitable to answer the user's question. In such a scenario I want my agent to reframe the user's question in a way that can lead to better retrieval results. And then retry the retrieve_context tool. This reframing of user's question and retrying the context retrieval can be done only once. Even if after doing so the context retrieved is not suitable to answer the user's question, the agent should respond saying "Relevant information cannot be found in database to answer the question. And ask the user to reframe the question.". 
Can you suggest what code changes are needed in rag_agent.py, elsewhere  to incorporate these logic changes.
