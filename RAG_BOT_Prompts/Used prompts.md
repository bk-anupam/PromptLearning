## Reranker Prompt: 
RAG_BOT is  an  agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. I have implement reranking mechanism in my RAG pipeline and what I observed was List[str] returned by my  retrieve_context tool becomes a str when accessed via last_message.content in the rerank_context_node. I got an explanation from an LLM about this behaviour. I want to understand how to correctly implement the reranking logic using langgraph if my retrieve_context tool returns a list of documents

Explanation:
ToolMessage.content attribute is designed to hold a string representation of the tool's output. As we saw, when a tool returns a non-string object like your List[str], the default behavior of the ToolNode is to serialize it (often using JSON) into that string content field. LangGraph's standard ToolNode serializes results into the ToolMessage.content string for compatibility and logging within the messages flow. However, tools themselves can return any Python object. You can access and use these complex objects either by:

Parsing the serialized string representation from ToolMessage.content.
Designing custom nodes that call the tool directly and store the raw Python object in a dedicated field within your AgentState.

## Need for json output prompt:
Why do we need to convert the LLM response to json format in our case. The final response is going to be display on telegram, hence it needs to be plain text. We don't get any benefit by asking LLM to provide final answer in json format. Can we just use the standard response 

## Past prompts used:
I am building a agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language, sometimes passing in date filter. Review the code in retriever_node function and suggest ways to improve the accuracy of search results from the vector db. Note that retriever_node is a node of the graph.


I am building a agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store. I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language, sometimes passing in date filter. My rag agent is kind of a conversational chatbot and retains at least the last 10 conversations in context so that it can answer the user queries with relevance. Can you suggest the code changes in bot.py and rag_agent.py to make this happen. 


I have built an MCP server named murli_mcp_server that works perfectly fine locally and allows me to retrieve pdf extracts from a local chroma db. Now this murli_mcp_server MCP server is to be used in rag_agent.py basically to perform the task currently being performed by the retriever_node. Basically I want the LLM(gemini 2.5 pro experimental) in rag_agent.py to be aware of the murli_mcp_server and use it when it deems fit that additional context (in form of murli extracts) is needed to answer a user query. I am using langgraph for building the agent. 
How does invoking tools exposed via an MCP server using a langgraph agent works. What is the best approach.


I want to extract the logic to retrieve pdf extracts from vectordb using a query from retriever_node in rag_agent.py and make this a tool call. Basically the retriever logic should be extracted into a new tool named murli_retriever (the tool logic can be a separate python file) and that tool is made available to the agent in rag_agent.py. The agent graph creation in build_agent method in rag_agent.py should be modified accordingly so that the agent makes a murli_retriever tool call when it deems necessary additional context information to answer user's question.

In the bind_agent method in rag_agent.py can't we do something like below
tools = [retrieve_murli_context]
llm.bind_tools(tools)
And then  use a ToolNode in the StateGraph. Just thinking if this would work. 


I have made changes to build_agent as per your suggestions. I want my agent stategraph structure to be like this: Agent -> Tool -> Agent -> End. Basically the agent node responds to the user query if no tool calls are needed. Can I just remove the generator_node logic and everything will work as expected. Currently system prompt is being used in the generator node, that needs to be taken care of in the agent node if generator node is to be removed.  


Can you explain the code in rag_agent.py step by step in detail. Basically I want to understand in detail how langgraph works under the hood to make the rag_agent functional. I understand that the code is building an agent that answers user's questions about Brahmakumaris murlis. It uses a murli_retriever_tool to retrieve murli extracts if it feels additional context is needed to answer the user's question. I basically want to understand in detail how the message flow happens, what are the different kinds of messages in langgraph, what is their use and how the code uses the messages in its workflow. Also I want to understand how langgraph performs state management of the agent, after execution of each node in the graph what exactly does langgraph do with the agent state.

RAG_BOT is  an  agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. In chroma vectorstore I am storing murli documents of several years. Each murli document is of a specific date. And for a particular month lets say you have 20 murli documents. I want to ask a question to LLM "What is the overall essence of murlis of Januray 1969?". Now this question is not going to find a semantic match in the documents, then how can I retrieve the relevant context for such queries in my RAG system.

I am building a agentic RAG system using langgraph and run as a telegram bot with chromadb as vector store.  I am storing the pdf documents in chromadb with date metadata and then trying to query the vectordb using natural language. In my RAG agent graph, I have an agent_node which Invokes the LLM instance bound with tools to decide the next step or generate a response. The next step can be a tool call basically the retrieve_context tool that retrieves relevant context snippets from Brahmakumaris murlis stored in a Chroma vector database based on the user query. 
Now there might be the case that the context retrieved is not suitable to answer the user's question. In such a scenario I want my agent to reframe the user's question in a way that can lead to better retrieval results. And then retry the retrieve_context tool. This reframing of user's question and retrying the context retrieval can be done only once. Even if after doing so the context retrieved is not suitable to answer the user's question, the agent should respond saying "Relevant information cannot be found in database to answer the question. And ask the user to reframe the question.". 
Can you suggest what code changes are needed in rag_agent.py, elsewhere  to incorporate these logic changes.

## Introduce memory in RAG BOT
#### Prompt 1:
So the current implementation of RAG BOT doesn't maintain conversational history. I want to implement a new feature so as to allow the bot to main conversational history for each user. I want you to suggest what are the different ways in which this can be implemented. I just need the approach, no code please. We first need to finalize the design and approach first. So put on your system design hat and help me dive in how to go about implementing this feature.

#### Response 1:
Of course. This is an excellent question and a critical feature for making the bot more intelligent and useful. Let's put on the system design hat and explore the different ways to
  implement conversational history, considering your current architecture.


  Analysis of Current Implementation

  First, let's acknowledge how your MessageHandler currently works:


   * Storage: It uses an in-memory Python dictionary (self.sessions).
   * Lifecycle: This history is ephemeral. It's lost every time the bot application restarts.
   * Scalability: This approach will not work if you scale your bot to run on multiple instances (e.g., in a container orchestration environment like Kubernetes), as each instance would
     have its own separate, isolated memory.
   * Agent Interaction: The _invoke_agent_and_get_response method correctly uses a thread_id when calling the agent, which is fantastic. However, it only passes the single, most recent
     HumanMessage to the agent's initial state. The agent itself has no memory of the previous turns in the conversation.

  Core Challenge


  The goal is to move from this ephemeral, in-memory storage to a persistent, scalable solution that correctly injects the conversation history into the agent for context-aware responses.

  Here are two primary design approaches to achieve this.

  ---


  Approach 1: The LangGraph-Native Approach (Highly Recommended)


  This approach leverages the built-in state management capabilities of LangGraph, which is the most idiomatic and robust way to solve this problem.

  Concept:


  LangGraph is designed for stateful applications. It has a Checkpointer mechanism that automatically saves and loads the entire state of your graph for a given thread_id. This includes
  the message history, any intermediate steps, and the current state of all nodes. You are already using thread_id, so you are halfway there.

  How it Works:


   1. Choose a Persistent Backend: Instead of an in-memory dictionary, you select a persistent storage backend that the checkpointer will use. LangGraph has built-in support for several:
       * SQLite: A simple, file-based database. Perfect for getting started and for single-instance deployments.
       * Redis: A high-performance, in-memory key-value store that can persist to disk. This is the ideal choice for production and for scalable, multi-instance deployments.
       * Postgres: A powerful relational database, suitable if you have complex query needs beyond simple history retrieval.


   2. Implement the Checkpointer:
       * You instantiate a checkpointer connected to your chosen backend (e.g., SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(":memory:/:memory:.db") or RedisSaver.from_conn_string("redis://...")).
       * You compile your StateGraph with this checkpointer: agent = graph.compile(checkpointer=my_checkpointer).


   3. Simplify `MessageHandler`:
       * The MessageHandler no longer needs to manage self.sessions or manually append to a conversation list.
       * When you call agent.ainvoke(..., config_thread), LangGraph's checkpointer automatically does the following:
           * Loads the previous state for that thread_id from your database (SQLite/Redis).
           * Runs the graph with the new message, allowing the agent to see the full history.
           * Saves the final, updated state back to the database.


  Advantages:
   * Simplicity: You write less code. LangGraph handles the complexity of state management.
   * Robustness: It saves the entire graph state, not just the messages. This is invaluable for debugging and more complex agent behaviors.
   * Scalability: Using a backend like Redis allows your bot to be stateless and scaled across many instances seamlessly.


  ---

  Approach 2: Manual History Management (Less Recommended)


  This approach involves manually fetching history from a database and constructing the agent's state before every call.

  Concept:


  You would replace the in-memory self.sessions dictionary with a direct connection to a database (like MongoDB, Redis, or a relational DB). Your code would be responsible for loading and
  saving the message history.

  How it Works:


   1. Choose a Database: Select a database to store conversation turns. A NoSQL database like MongoDB or a key-value store like Redis are good fits for storing a list of messages per user.


   2. Modify `MessageHandler`:
       * In _invoke_agent_and_get_response, before calling the agent:
           1. Query your database to get the last N messages for the given chat_id.
           2. Manually construct a list of HumanMessage and AIMessage objects from the retrieved history.
           3. Prepend this history list to the new HumanMessage in the initial_state passed to agent.ainvoke.
       * After getting a response from the agent:
           1. Manually save the user's new message and the bot's new response back to the database for that chat_id.


  Disadvantages:
   * More Boilerplate Code: You are essentially re-implementing the logic that LangGraph's checkpointer provides for free.
   * Incomplete State: You are only saving the final messages, not the rich, intermediate state of the agent's "thought process," which the checkpointer would preserve.
   * Prone to Errors: Manual state management can be complex to get right, especially handling race conditions or ensuring data consistency.

  Comparison and Recommendation


![[Pasted image 20250726110058.png]]

  Final Recommendation
  


  My strong recommendation is to use the LangGraph-Native Approach (Approach 1).


  It is the most robust, scalable, and idiomatic solution that aligns perfectly with your existing tools. It requires minimal code changes and provides the most benefit.


  Suggested Next Steps:


   1. Choose a Backend: Start with SQLite for simplicity. You can create a single database.db file.
   2. Update Agent Initialization: In the code where you build and compile your StateGraph, add the checkpointer.
   3. Refactor `MessageHandler`: Remove the self.sessions dictionary and the manual _update_session logic. The checkpointer makes it redundant.
   4. Test: Run your bot. You will see that it now remembers the conversation across restarts. When you are ready to scale, you can switch from the SqliteSaver to the RedisSaver with a
      one-line code change.

### Prompt 2:
Okay, that's a really thorough explanation. What about langmem, 

#### Response 2
Based on my research, langmem is a highly suitable choice for managing conversational history in your LangGraph RAG agent. Here’s a summary of my findings and why I recommend it:

  What is langmem?


  langmem is a library designed to provide agents with long-term memory, enabling them to learn from interactions, personalize responses, and maintain context over extended conversations.
  It is tightly integrated with LangGraph and its storage system.

  Key Features and Suitability for Your RAG Agent:


   * Seamless LangGraph Integration: langmem is built to work with LangGraph's state management and storage, making it a natural fit for your existing architecture. You can add it as a node
     in your graph to process and manage memory.
   * Automatic Summarization: It provides pre-built components (SummarizationNode and summarize_messages) to automatically summarize conversation history. This is a critical feature for any
     chatbot, as it prevents the context window from overflowing while still retaining important information from earlier in the conversation.
   * Two Modes for Memory Management:
       1. Hot Path (Active): The agent can be given tools (create_manage_memory_tool, create_search_memory_tool) to consciously decide when to save or retrieve information.
       2. Background (Passive): You can set up a create_memory_store_manager to "subconsciously" observe conversations and automatically extract and save important memories. This is ideal
          for a RAG agent, as it can build a knowledge base of user preferences and past interactions without needing explicit instructions.
   * Structured Memory: langmem can store memories as structured data (using Pydantic models) in addition to unstructured text. This allows you to create a more organized and easily
     queryable memory, such as storing user profile information or specific facts.
   * Enhanced RAG Capabilities: By maintaining a conversational memory, langmem can significantly improve your RAG agent. The agent can:
       * Use past interactions to formulate better, more context-aware queries for your vector store.
       * Combine information retrieved from the RAG pipeline with its own memory to provide more comprehensive and personalized answers.
   * User-Specific Memory: It supports organizing memories into "namespaces," which makes it easy to maintain separate conversational histories for different users.

  Recommendation:


  Yes, `langmem` is an excellent choice for maintaining conversational history in your LangGraph RAG agent. It directly addresses the core challenges of managing long conversations and
  offers powerful features for personalization and context-awareness that will enhance your agent's capabilities. The background memory extraction and summarization features are
  particularly well-suited for a sophisticated RAG chatbot.


  I would recommend starting with the background_quickstart and summarization guides from the documentation to implement it in your agent.

#### Prompt 3: 
So what is your recommendation, use langgraph checkpointer mechanism or langmem for maintaining converstational history.  │

#### Response 3:

That's an excellent and crucial question. The answer is that you should use both, as they serve two different, complementary purposes. They are not mutually exclusive choices.

  Here’s a breakdown to clarify:


   * LangGraph Checkpointer: Its job is state persistence and fault tolerance. It saves the entire state of your graph at each step. Think of it as a "save game" feature.
   * LangMem: Its job is intelligent memory management for the LLM. It processes, summarizes, and extracts key facts from the conversation to manage the context window and provide long-term
     memory. Think of it as the agent's "brain" or "notebook."


  Analogy: A Court Reporter vs. a Lawyer's Notes


   * A LangGraph Checkpointer is like a court reporter. It creates a perfect, verbatim transcript of everything that has happened in the "conversation" (the graph execution). If the power
     goes out, you can read the transcript and resume exactly where you left off. It doesn't summarize or interpret anything; it just records.


   * LangMem is like a lawyer's notebook. The lawyer doesn't write down every single word. They listen to the full transcript and then write down:
       * Summaries: "The witness's testimony from this morning can be condensed to these three points." (This is SummarizationNode).
       * Key Facts: "Remember: The witness confirmed they own a red car." (This is background memory extraction).
       * Action Items: "I need to ask the next witness about the red car." (This is the agent using its memory to inform its next action).


  The lawyer uses their notes (LangMem) to form their arguments, not the entire court transcript (Checkpointer state).


  My Recommendation: Use Both in Your RAG Agent


   1. Use a Checkpointer as your foundation. This is non-negotiable for any real chatbot. Use langgraph.checkpoint.memory.MemorySaver for in-memory persistence during development or a more
      robust backend like langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver for production. This guarantees that the full, unabridged history of every conversation is safely stored.


   2. Add `langmem` as an intelligent layer on top.
       * In your LangGraph, right before you call your main RAG agent/LLM, insert langmem's SummarizationNode.
       * This node will take the full message history (which it gets from the state loaded by the checkpointer) and intelligently condense it.
       * It will pass the new, summarized context to your agent.
       * This way, your agent always has the relevant context it needs to function, without you ever having to worry about exceeding the token limit.


  This combined approach gives you the best of both worlds: the robustness of a checkpointer and the intelligence of langmem.

#### Prompt 4:
So based on your recommendation let's us implement LangGraph Checkpointer for state persistence (specially conversation history) in RAG BOT. I need you to go through the code base and come up first with a detailed implementation plan for this. I just need the plan, no code for now. We will implement the code once we have finalized the implementation approach.

#### Response 4:
Based on my analysis of your codebase, here is a detailed implementation plan for integrating a LangGraph Checkpointer to provide persistent conversational history for your RAG
  bot.


  The core idea is to use a persistent backend (like SQLite) to automatically save and load the state of your conversation graph, making your bot's memory durable across restarts and
  long-running interactions.

  Implementation Plan: LangGraph Checkpointer Integration


  This plan is divided into three phases: introducing the checkpointer, refactoring the existing session logic to avoid redundancy, and making the implementation configurable.


  Phase 1: Introduce and Configure the Checkpointer

  The goal of this phase is to get the checkpointer wired into the graph compilation process.


   1. Modify `RAG_BOT/bot.py`:
       * Import `SqliteSaver`: Add from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver to the top of the file.
       * Instantiate the Checkpointer: In the main_setup_and_run function, create an instance of the checkpointer. This will be the single source of persistence.


   1         # In main_setup_and_run(), after config is loaded
   2         config = Config()
   3         # ...
   4         # Add this line
   5         checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("rag_bot_checkpoints.db")
   6         logger.info("Initialized SQLite checkpointer.")

       * Pass Checkpointer to Initializer: The TelegramBotApp needs to pass the checkpointer to where the agent is built. We will modify initialize_agent_and_handler for this.
           * In TelegramBotApp, change the signature of initialize_agent_and_handler to accept the checkpointer:


   1             # Change this:
   2             # async def initialize_agent_and_handler(self, vectordb_for_agent, config_for_agent):
   3             # To this:
   4             async def initialize_agent_and_handler(self, vectordb_for_agent, config_for_agent, checkpointer):

           * Update the call to build_agent inside this method to pass the checkpointer along:


   1             # Change this:
   2             # self.agent = await build_agent(vectordb=vectordb_for_agent, config_instance=config_for_agent)
   3             # To this:
   4             self.agent = await build_agent(vectordb=vectordb_for_agent, config_instance=config_for_agent, checkpointer=checkpointer)

       * Update the `_async_init_for_bot_app` call: In main_setup_and_run, update the call within the _async_init_for_bot_app coroutine to pass the newly created checkpointer instance.


   1         # In main_setup_and_run() -> _async_init_for_bot_app()
   2         # Change this:
   3         # await bot_app.initialize_agent_and_handler(vectordb, config)
   4         # To this:
   5         await bot_app.initialize_agent_and_handler(vectordb, config, checkpointer)



   2. Modify `RAG_BOT/agent/graph_builder.py`:
       * Update `build_agent` Signature: Modify the function to accept the checkpointer object.


   1         # Change this:
   2         # async def build_agent(vectordb: Chroma, config_instance: Config) -> StateGraph:
   3         # To this:
   4         async def build_agent(vectordb: Chroma, config_instance: Config, checkpointer) -> StateGraph:

       * Compile Graph with Checkpointer: In the final step of build_agent, pass the checkpointer to the compile() method. This is the step that activates persistence.


   1         # Change this:
   2         # graph = builder.compile()
   3         # To this:
   4         graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)



  Phase 2: Refactor Redundant Session Management


  With the checkpointer managing the authoritative conversation history (messages in AgentState), the manual history tracking in MessageHandler becomes redundant and can lead to
  confusion.


   1. Modify `RAG_BOT/message_handler.py`:
       * Remove `_update_session` Method: This method's only purpose is to append to a manual conversation list. It is no longer needed and should be deleted.
       * Simplify `_get_user_session`: This method can be kept for managing user-specific preferences (language, mode), but the 'conversation': [] key is obsolete and should be removed from
         the new session dictionary.
       * Update `process_message`:
           * Remove the call to self._update_session(...) at the end of the method.
           * The logic for the "last message" command relies on the manual conversation history. This feature will no longer work and should be removed to prevent errors.

  Phase 3: Final Configuration


  To make the solution robust, we should avoid hardcoding the database file name.


   2. Update `RAG_BOT/config.py` (and/or `.env`):
       * Add a new configuration variable for the checkpointer database path. For example:
          CHECKPOINTER_DB_PATH="rag_bot_checkpoints.db"


   3. Update `RAG_BOT/bot.py`:
       * In main_setup_and_run, use this new config variable when creating the SqliteSaver instance.


   1         # Change this:
   2         # checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("rag_bot_checkpoints.db")
   3         # To this:
   4         checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(config.CHECKPOINTER_DB_PATH)


  ---


  Once this plan is implemented, your RAG bot will have a fully persistent memory. Every conversation, identified by the user's chat_id, will be saved automatically. When a user continues
  a conversation, the graph will resume from its exact previous state.

#### Prompt 5:
How many conversations or messages are going to be stored in checkpointer memory. If conversation history becomes too long, it may impact the limited context window we have. How can this risk be mitigated? Just tell me the plan without writing any code.

#### Response 5:
Here is the plan to mitigate the risk of an overflowing context window.

  Summary of the Situation


   1. Checkpointer Storage: You are correct, the checkpointer will store every single message for a given conversation (thread_id) indefinitely. It is a complete, unabridged, and
      ever-growing log. Its purpose is durability, not context management.


   2. The Risk: If you pass the entire message history (which could be hundreds of turns long) directly to the LLM on every turn, you will quickly exceed its context window limit, leading to
      errors and high token costs.


  The Mitigation Plan: Implement a Smart Context Management Layer


  The solution is to separate the durable storage (the checkpointer) from the working memory (the context you actually send to the LLM). We will introduce a summarization layer into the
  graph that runs before the main agent logic on every turn.


  This is the exact problem langmem is designed to solve, and we will plan to use its concepts.

  ---


  Step 1: Introduce a Summarization Node


  The first step is to add a dedicated node to your graph whose only job is to manage the conversation history.


   * What it is: This will be a new node in your graph, let's call it summarization_node.
   * What it does: On each turn, this node will receive the entire message history from the AgentState (which was loaded by the checkpointer). It will then apply a summarization strategy:
       * It will keep the most recent messages as they are.
       * It will take the older messages and use an LLM to create a concise summary.
       * Its final output will be a new, condensed list of messages consisting of [summary_of_old_messages] + [recent_messages].
   * Tooling: We will plan to use langmem.short_term.SummarizationNode for this, as it's pre-built for this exact purpose.

  Step 2: Update the Agent State


  The SummarizationNode needs a place to store its running summary so it doesn't have to re-summarize the same messages over and over.


   * File to Modify: RAG_BOT/agent/state.py
   * The Change: Add a new field to the AgentState TypedDict to hold the summarization context.


   1     # In AgentState
   2     from langmem.short_term import RunningSummary # Add this import
   3 
   4     class AgentState(TypedDict):
   5         # ... existing fields ...
   6         # Add this field for the summarization node to use
   7         context_summary: RunningSummary | None

      (Note: The `SummarizationNode` from `langmem` is designed to work with a field like this automatically).


  Step 3: Modify the Graph Execution Flow


  We need to reroute the graph so that the summarization step always happens before the LLM is called.


   * File to Modify: RAG_BOT/agent/graph_builder.py
   * The Changes:
       1. Add the New Node: Instantiate the SummarizationNode and add it to the builder.
       2. Change the Entry Point: The graph's entry point will no longer be agent_initial. It will now be summarization_node.
       3. Define New Edges:
           * Create an edge from START to summarization_node.
           * Create an edge from summarization_node to agent_initial.
           * Crucially, update the loops: Any edge that currently points back to agent_initial (e.g., from reframe_query or after a tool call) must now point to summarization_node instead.
             This ensures that after a tool is used or a query is reframed, the newly added messages are included in the next summarization cycle before the LLM sees them.


  Step 4: Update the Agent Node to Use the Summarized Context


  The main agent node must be told to use the new, condensed message list instead of the full history.


   * File to Modify: RAG_BOT/agent/agent_node.py
   * The Change: The agent_node function currently gets messages from state.get('messages', []). It will need to be modified to use the output of the summarization_node. The
     SummarizationNode typically places its output in a new state key (e.g., summarized_messages). The agent node will read from this new key to prepare its prompt for the LLM, while the
     original messages key remains the complete, unabridged source of truth managed by the checkpointer.

  Step 5: Make Summarization Configurable


  The summarization process has key parameters (e.g., how many tokens to allow before summarizing). These should not be hardcoded.


   * File to Modify: RAG_BOT/config.py
   * The Change: Add new configuration variables like MAX_TOKENS_BEFORE_SUMMARY and MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS. These will be used when instantiating the SummarizationNode in the graph_builder.py,
     allowing you to easily tune the bot's memory behavior.


  By implementing this plan, you achieve the perfect architecture: the checkpointer provides infinite, durable storage, and the summarization node provides an intelligent, context-aware
  filter that protects your LLM from context overflow.

### Prompt 6: 
Now that we are using google firestore as the persistent store for saving langgraph checkpoints using AsyncFireStoreSaver, the previous conversations will keep on getting summarized. And beyond a certain number of conversations, the token constraint on the summary will lead to over compression of the past conversation leading to a not so meaningful summary. The best alternative in such a case is to start a new conversation thread (probably using a new threadid) once past conversations summary has been triggered N number of times. Here N is a threshold. What do you think about this approach. May be we would then need to provide a way to the user to view past conversation threads.
Most LLM interfaces like chatgpt etc. use such an approach I guess. Donning the role of an architect and a systems design thinker, can you delve deeper into this requirement and come up with an elegant approach as to how can we implement a solution to this issue in RAG BOT. Let's focus on the approach first without doing the actual code changes.

#### Response 6 (Refined):
Refined Approach
: Hybrid Session Management

  This approach combines the scalable sub-collection data model from the first proposal with the transactional, agent-aware state management from the second.

  1. Core Principle: Decoupled & Scalable Threads

  We will treat each conversation as a distinct "thread" or "session." A user can have multiple threads, but only one is active at a time. This is managed through a dedicated
  sub-collection in Firestore, which is more scalable than storing threads in an array.

  2. Data Model: Firestore Sub-collection (The Best of Approach 1)

  We will use a sub-collection to store conversation threads for each user. This avoids Firestore's 1 MiB document size limit and allows for efficient querying.

  The structure will look like this:

   1 /users/{user_id}/ (Document for user-specific settings)
   2   - language_code: "en"
   3   - ... other settings ...
   4 
   5   /users/{user_id}/threads/{thread_id}/ (Document for a single conversation thread)
   6     - created_at: Timestamp
   7     - last_updated_at: Timestamp
   8     - title: "Discussion on Karma and Destiny"
   9     - active: true

   * `users/{user_id}`: This document, managed by UserSettingsManager, holds global settings for the user.
   * `threads` Sub-collection: This is the key change. Each document in this collection is a conversation thread. The document's ID will be the thread_id used by LangGraph's checkpointer.
   * `active: true`: A query for the document with this flag is how we find the user's current conversation. This is simple and fast.
   * `title`: A user-friendly title, which can be auto-generated by an LLM upon thread archival, as suggested in Approach 2.

  Component to Change:
   * /home/bk_anupam/code/LLM_agents/RAG_BOT/src/persistence/user_settings_manager.py: This manager will be enhanced to handle the threads sub-collection.
       * get_active_thread(user_id): Queries for the thread document where active == true.
       * start_new_thread(user_id, old_thread_id=None, title=None):
           1. If old_thread_id is provided, it sets active: false and updates the title on the old thread document.
           2. Creates a new document in the threads sub-collection with a unique ID, active: true, and returns the new thread_id.
       * list_threads(user_id): Queries and returns all documents from the threads sub-collection.
       * switch_active_thread(user_id, new_thread_id): Manages setting the active flag between old and new threads.

  3. Agent State: Transactional Counter (The Best of Approach 2)

  This is the most critical part for reliability. We will track the summarization count within the agent's own state. This ensures the counter is always in sync with the conversation
  history, as it's part of the same atomic checkpoint.

  File to Modify: `/home/bk_anupam/code/LLM_agents/RAG_BOT/src/agent/state.py`

   1 class AgentState(TypedDict):
   2     # ... existing fields
   3     summarization_count: int

  Component to Change: The Summarization Node (e.g., in agent/graph_builder.py or agent/custom_nodes.py)
   * The node that performs summarization will now be responsible for incrementing this counter. When it returns its output, the new state will include summarization_count: current_count + 
     1. The checkpointer handles the persistence automatically.

  4. Orchestration Logic: Pre-flight Check in the Message Handler

  The decision to create a new thread will happen in the MessageHandler before invoking the agent. This is the perfect place to orchestrate the entire flow.

  File to Modify: `/home/bk_anupam/code/LLM_agents/RAG_BOT/src/services/message_handler.py`

  New Logic:
   5. On receiving a message, get the user_id.
   6. Call user_settings_manager.get_active_thread(user_id) to get the active thread document and its thread_id. If none exists, create the first one.
   7. Use the checkpointer.aget_tuple(config={"configurable": {"thread_id": active_thread_id}}) to fetch the latest state for that thread.
   8. Inspect the summarization_count from the state.
   9. If `summarization_count >= N` (our threshold):
      a.  Archive & Title: Use the final summary from the checkpoint to ask an LLM to generate a concise title for the conversation that just ended.
      b.  Create New Thread: Call user_settings_manager.start_new_thread(user_id, old_thread_id=active_thread_id, title=newly_generated_title). This archives the old thread and creates a
  new active one.
      c.  Notify User: Inform the user that a new chat has been started for focus, and they can use /threads to see their history.
      d.  Use the new `thread_id` to process the current message.
   10. If `summarization_count < N`:
      a.  Use the existing `active_thread_id` to process the message.

  11. User Experience: Clear and Simple Commands

  The Telegram bot will be updated with intuitive commands for managing threads.

  File to Modify: `/home/bk_anupam/code/LLM_agents/RAG_BOT/src/telegram/bot.py`

   * /newchat: Manually triggers the start_new_thread flow.
   * /threads (or /chats): Calls user_settings_manager.list_threads(user_id) and formats the output nicely, assigning a simple number to each thread for easy switching.

   1     Your chats:
   2     1. (Active) AI and Consciousness
   3     2. Discussion on Karma and Destiny
   4     3. Initial chat about the soul
   5 
   6     Use /switch <number> to change chats.
   * /switch `<number>`: The handler translates the number to a thread_id from the list and calls user_settings_manager.switch_active_thread.

  Summary of the Refined Approach

  This hybrid design gives us:
   * Scalability: The Firestore sub-collection model can handle a virtually unlimited number of threads per user.
   * Robustness: The summarization_count is transactionally tied to the conversation state, preventing any drift or inconsistency.
   * Elegance: A clean separation of concerns. UserSettingsManager handles the metadata about threads, while LangGraph's Checkpointer handles the content of threads.
   * Great UX: The process is automated, but users are given full control to navigate their history, just like in modern LLM chat applications.


#### Response 6:
You've hit on a crucial point in the lifecycle of long-running conversational agents. Your analysis is spot on. Simply summarizing a summary of a summary will inevitably lead to context
  degradation, what's often called "context collapse." The proposed solution of starting a new conversation thread after a certain threshold is an excellent, industry-standard approach.

  Let's delve deeper into this from an architectural and systems design perspective for the RAG BOT.

  The Core Concept: Episodic Conversation Management

  Instead of a single, infinitely growing conversation, we will treat user interactions as a series of distinct "episodes" or "threads". Each episode has its own isolated context and
  history. The user can have one active episode at a time, but can list and switch back to previous ones.

  This approach provides several key benefits:
   1. Context Integrity: Prevents the over-compression of history, ensuring the agent always has a high-fidelity summary to work with for the current topic.
   2. Scalability: Firestore reads and writes remain efficient as we're always working with a reasonably sized checkpoint, not one that grows indefinitely.
   3. User Experience: Mimics familiar interfaces like ChatGPT, giving users explicit control over their conversational history. It's organized and intuitive.
   4. Topical Separation: Users can naturally create separate threads for different topics (e.g., one for spiritual philosophy, another for technical questions about the bot itself),
      preventing context bleed.

  Proposed Architectural Design

  Here’s a breakdown of the necessary changes to the data model, application logic, and user interface (Telegram commands).

  1. Data Model Changes (Firestore)

  We need a new data structure to manage these conversation episodes. I propose a new top-level collection or a sub-collection under each user. Let's assume we have a users collection.

    1 users/{user_id}/ (Document)
    2   - user_preferences (e.g., language)
    3   - ... other user data ...
    4 
    5   conversations/ (Sub-collection)
    6     {conversation_id_1}/ (Document)
    7       - thread_id: "langgraph_thread_id_abc"  // The actual ID used by LangGraph checkpointer
    8       - created_at: Timestamp
    9       - last_updated_at: Timestamp
   10       - active: true
   11       - summarization_count: 2
   12       - title: "Initial discussion on RAG" // Auto-generated or user-set title
   13 
   14     {conversation_id_2}/ (Document)
   15       - thread_id: "langgraph_thread_id_xyz"
   16       - created_at: Timestamp
   17       - last_updated_at: Timestamp
   18       - active: false
   19       - summarization_count: 5
   20       - title: "Exploring system design"

   * `conversations` Sub-collection: Each document within this collection represents a single conversation episode.
   * `thread_id`: This is the crucial link. It's the configurable={"thread_id": "..."} that AsyncFireStoreSaver uses to isolate checkpoints.
   * `active`: A boolean flag to quickly find the current conversation for a user. Only one can be true at any time.
   * `summarization_count`: This is our threshold counter (N). It will be incremented each time the summarization node in the graph is triggered for this episode.
   * `title`: A user-friendly name for the conversation. We can auto-generate this from the first few words of the first message and allow the user to rename it later.

  2. Core Logic Changes

   3. `MessageHandler` Modification:
       * When a message arrives, MessageHandler will first query the users/{user_id}/conversations collection to find the document where active: true.
       * It will retrieve the thread_id from that document.
       * This thread_id will then be passed into the agent.stream() or agent.invoke() call, ensuring the agent uses the correct checkpoint.
       * If no active conversation exists (e.g., for a new user), it will create one.

   4. `graph_builder.py` (Summarize Node Logic):
       * The node responsible for summarizing the conversation history needs to be updated.
       * After successfully creating a summary, it must perform an out-of-band Firestore update: It will increment the summarization_count on the active conversations document.

   5. Automatic Episode Creation (The "N" Threshold):
       * Inside the MessageHandler or perhaps as a subsequent step after the agent replies, we'll check the summarization_count.
       * If summarization_count >= N (where N is our configured threshold, e.g., 5), we trigger the creation of a new episode.
       * Workflow:
          a. Set active: false on the current conversation document.
          b. Create a new conversation document with a new thread_id, set active: true, and summarization_count: 0.
          c. Send a message to the user informing them: "This conversation has grown quite long. To keep our focus sharp, I've archived it and started a new one. You can always go back 
  with the `/list_chats` command."

  6. User Interface (New Telegram Commands)

  To give the user control, we need to introduce a few new slash commands in telegram/bot.py:

   * /newchat:
       * Allows the user to manually start a new conversation episode.
       * Sets the current active chat to active: false.
       * Creates a new conversation record, making it the active one.
       * Responds with "New chat started."

   * /listchats:
       * Queries the user's conversations collection in Firestore.
       * Formats the list of conversations nicely for the user, perhaps with titles and creation dates, and indicates which one is active.
       * Example Reply:

   1         Your conversations:
   2         1. Initial discussion on RAG (Archived)
   3         2. Exploring system design (Active)
   4 
   5         Use /switchchat <number> to change conversations.

   * /switchchat `<number>`:
       * Allows the user to switch their active context to a previous conversation.
       * The logic would find the current active chat, set it to false, then find the target chat (by the number from the list) and set it to active: true.
       * Responds with: "Switched back to 'Initial discussion on RAG'."

   * /renamechat `<number> <new_title>` (Optional but nice):
       * Allows the user to rename a conversation for better organization.

  This approach provides a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution to the context collapse problem. It cleanly separates the concern of conversation management from the agent's core
  RAG logic and gives the user explicit control over their interaction history.
What are your thoughts on this proposed architecture?
