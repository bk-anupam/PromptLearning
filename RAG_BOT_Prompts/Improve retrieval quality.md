## Prompt:
If I have indexed the murlis in a vector database, what is the best way to retrieve the relevant murli passages.

## Model: GPT-4o
## Response:
If you've indexed the Murlis in a vector database, you're well-positioned to retrieve relevant passages efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the best practices and techniques:

**1. Semantic Search with Embeddings:**

* **Query Embedding:**
    * Convert your query ("What is the purpose of human life?") into a vector embedding using the same model you used to embed the Murli passages.
* **Similarity Search:**
    * Perform a similarity search in your vector database. This will find the Murli passages whose embeddings are most similar to your query embedding.
    * Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity and dot product.
* **Retrieve Relevant Passages:**
    * Retrieve the text associated with the top-k most similar vectors. The "k" value determines how many passages you retrieve.

**2. Metadata Filtering (If Applicable):**

* **Metadata Enrichment:**
    * If you've added metadata to your vector database (e.g., date, topic, speaker), use metadata filters to refine your search.
* **Combined Search:**
    * Combine semantic search with metadata filters. For example, you could search for passages related to "purpose of life" and filter by passages from a specific year or speaker.
* **Example:** If you tagged certain murlis with the topic "purpose of life" you could combine the vector search, with a metadata filter to only return results with that tag.

**3. Contextual Windowing:**

* **Expand Retrieved Passages:**
    * Instead of retrieving only the exact matching passages, retrieve a larger contextual window around them. This provides more context for the AI to understand the meaning.
    * This can be done by retrieving the passages before and after the matched passage.
* **Chunking Strategy:**
    * The way you initially chunked your murlis for embedding will impact the quality of your results. If you chunked by paragraph, then retrieving the surrounding paragraphs is simple. If you used a different method, you will need to adjust your retrieval logic.

**4. Reranking:**

* **Cross-Encoder Models:**
    * After retrieving the top-k passages, use a cross-encoder model to rerank them. Cross-encoders are more accurate than bi-encoders (used for initial embedding) but are also more computationally expensive.
    * This reranking step helps to ensure that the most relevant passages are at the top of the list.
* **Relevance Scoring:**
    * The cross encoder will produce a relevance score that can be used to sort the retrieved passages.
